# getBhavCopy

getBhavCopy is a GitHub cron job that automates the process of downloading the bhavcopy in TXT format daily and uploading it to Google Drive. This project is specifically tailored for users of AmiBroker software, allowing them to easily load the data for the respective dates into their software.

## Features

- **Automated Downloads**: The cron job runs at around 9:30 PM every day to download the bhavcopy.
- **Google Drive Upload**: The downloaded bhavcopy is uploaded to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wA5duO0osm4mrZ8g5iJuh_pmkr8wD6vG). You can download the files from this link.
- **Manual Workflow Dispatch**: In case the cron job does not run, there is a workflow dispatch option available to manually trigger the download and upload process.

## Usage

The bhavcopy files generated by this project are specially formatted for use with AmiBroker software. You can upload these files to AmiBroker to load the data for the particular date into your software.

1. Go to the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.
2. Select the workflow named "getBhavCopy".
3. Click on "Run workflow" to manually trigger the download and upload process.
